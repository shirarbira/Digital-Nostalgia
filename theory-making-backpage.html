<p>In “The Transmission of Affect”, Brennan explores the foreign, obscure, and seemingly inexplainable concept of understanding how one feels affect. Brennan notes that while everyone can physically feel the affect—something is present that was not there before—there is a severe lack of vocabulary and theory for explaining and describing this sensation.</p><br>
<p>My project explores the affect of nostalgia—the biological sensation that cannot be limited to a mere emotional adjective. While sentimentality is often associated, this term fails to incorporate the stomach-churning-but-euphoric intensity of nostalgia.</p><br>
Brennan’s work is specifically interested in the notion of affect transcending the dichotomy between the environment and the individual—concepts we tend to polarize. Following this idea, my project will attempt to discover whether the type of environment, or in this case, the medium, changes the affect on the individual. Is there a difference between nostalgia experienced through a physical picture and nostalgia experienced through a digital filter? Does the environment alter the transmission of effect if the environment is virtual?</p>

<p>In “The Autonomy of Affect” Massumi too attempts to conceptualize affect. For Massumi, the sensation of affect can be equated with “intensity”: “intensity is embodied in purely autonomic reactions most directly manifested in the skin” (25), “intensity is qualifiable as an emotional state, and that state is static—temporal and narrative noise. It is a state of suspense, potentially of disruption. It is like a temporal sink, a hole in time, as we conceive of it and narrativize it” (26).</p><br>
<p>Massumi is particularly interested as he relates affect with time, or more specifically, the lack of linear time. This nonlinear narrative, this temporal sink, he speaks of, can be applied as a description of nostalgia—a sensation felt that transposes time and space. Often, we feel nostalgia for things, places, and people we’ve never encountered; nostalgia is completely nonlinear and entirely abstract—a biological sensation arises in the present from something in the past. As such, we cannot logically explain nostalgia; it is “a complexity too rich to be functionally expressed” (29), moving beyond logic, time, and linear thought.</p><br>

<p> Has affect become a “marketable and transferrable commodity for the information age” (Kember 174) with platforms such as Etsy and the Impossible Projects, integrating nostalgia and technology as a business? Is this a form of “inventing well”? In “Life After New Media” Kember writes of the creative labor force as an “affective form of labor” (175), is this what’s occurring here? Is digitizing the sensation of nostalgia “creative media” or just something wrong—something that shouldn’t be tampered with, especially for a marketing purpose.</p><br>
<p>My project is an exploration of the questions can digital technologies recreate the affect of nostalgia? Does the environment matter in experiencing affect? Can nostalgia, something nonlinear and completely abstract, be codified and digitized?</p><br>

<p>As I continue to critically observe my ecological site both physically (The Impossible Project headquarters on Broadway) and digitally (their app), I’ve begun to notice an emphasis on sharing—sharing photos, sharing an experience, sharing a transmission of affect.</p><br>
<p>At their headquarters, I have captured video of people’s interaction with the framed “portroid” wall, as well as a video of two people interacting on a more personal level with a photo album. Similarly, I’ve captured images from their app of the “gallery” component, which is “designed for sharing analog instant photos”. Users of the app have the ability to comment and “like” the picture, as well as see the film used, with a link that brings the user to the “shop” to purchase the film.</p><br>

<p>This emphasis stands in stark contrast to the original marketing of the Polaroid cameras. In this commercial from 1974, the experience is more about capturing an intimate memory for personal keepings. It seems there is a connection between the affect of nostalgia and the concept of “cultural content”, as discussed in Terranova’s article on Free Labor.</p><br>

<p>Terranova writes, “Free labor is the moment where this knowledgeable consumption of culture is translated into productive activities that are pleasurably embraced and at the same time often shamelessly exploited” (4).</p><br>
<p>Such is the ultimate goal of The Impossible Project—to turn consumption of culture—the sharing of polaroids—into activities that are pleasurably embraced, as a result of the nostalgic sentiment, and shamelessly exploited, into profit. The whole assemblage of the business functions from this immaterial labor; “immaterial labor can be understood to pervade the social body with different degrees of intensity” (Terranova 7).</p><br>
<p>While the company seeks to evoke nostalgia, a bittersweet homage to the past, it cannot ignore the present—the digital economy that is currently pervading culture. “After all, if we do not get on-line soon, the hype suggests, we will become obsolete, unnecessary, disposable. If we do, we are promised, we will become part of the “hive mind,” the immaterial economy of networked, intelligent subjects in charge of speeding up the rhythms of capital’s ‘incessant waves of branching innovations’.” (Terranova 5).</p><br>
<p>In order for the affect of nostalgia to be transmitted, the digital-age sensibility must be present. The polaroid film only becomes valorized when it can be scanned through their app and shared on their gallery. At that point, the affect becomes what is capitalized on. At this point, Brennan’s work “The Transmission of Affect”, resonates with the relationship between affect and groups: “One can have an enduring affective interaction with the other, which positions both parties in ongoing related affective personas. . . At this level, the energetic affects of others enter the person, and the person’s affects, in turn, are transmitted to the environment. Here lies the key to why it is that people in groups, crowds, and gatherings can often be ‘of one mind’.” (Brennan 8). It will be my goal to capture the relationship between groups and the transmission of affect in my videos and gallery.</p></div>
