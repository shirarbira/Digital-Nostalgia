<p>evil</p><br>
<p>In the very first sentence of the book, authors Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey state their purpose for writing the text: 'Evil Media is an attempt to develop an understanding of contemporary media systems, techniques, and practices of mediation in era of participation, [and] of massive networks' (1). For the authors, these systems, techniques, and practices facilitate and amplify the evils of media; the subtopic 'Evil' explores what exactly this means.  In the context of mediation, evil is inextricably linked with both emotion and affect: 'dread, fear, and foreboding'. . . 'delight, terror, geeky enthusiasm, mildly hypnotic euphoria, ugly feelings, and paranoid rage' (4). The authors assert, 'such subjective dispositions are the outcome of specific sociotechnical configurations' (4). Part of what makes media evil, and thus what causes these dispositions to arise, is the 'all-pervasive extension of digital communication'. The notion of media being everywhere always has given a certain looming omnipresence to the various machines at play, giving rise to user’s heightened awareness, anxiety, and even discomfort. In conceptualizing media as all-pervasive, its processes and networks become abstract and ambiguous, effectively creating the foreboding 'opaque zones of nonknowledge' which epitomizes the evils of media (3). The authors propose a cultivation of knowledge that recognizes the manipulations of media and further, enlightens users on how to manipulate such technologies. To cultivate this knowledge, 'constant vigilance in strategematic thought' is necessary (7); for the evils of media are opaque and recessive—hidden beyond the mere surface of what a specific media object is or does.</p><br>

The evils of media are often unidentifiable and evoke affect rather than emotion. In a time where digital communication is all-pervasive, the rare moments when we are unattached demonstrate media's vicious character. Such are the brief minutes underground while taking the Subway, or the unforgiveable mistake of leaving one's device at home. During these periods, a wave of anxiety overcomes those who have been momentarily disconnected. 'How many people are trying to reach me, how many notification will I have when I return to my device, what if someone needs me?' are all questions attacking the mind of one who's disconnected. It is not the periods of disconnection that demonstrate the evils of media, but rather the second before service is re-connected, or seconds before the phone turns back on, having run out of battery. In these moments, we anticipate the notifications, the messages, the self validation that stems from someone needing to reach us. This anticipation is not an identifiable emotion, but rather an affect--something that is physically felt yet indescribable. Of course, this affective sensation can lead to real emotion-such as frustration or disappointment upon realizing there are no notifications.</p><br>
<p>Togetherness</p>
<p>In the first essay from the chapter, 'Social Engineering;, the famous Chinese room, Milgram’s test of obedience and the Turing test are all presented to show 'cases in which control, agency, and intelligence are functionally partitioned by the use of a sealed container and the introduction of a means of communication between inside and out' (49). In these examples, technology intersects with the thinking person in that various human factors, such as curiosity, translation, and eagerness to please, affect the function 'inside the box' so to speak. In one of the later essays within the section, 'Flirting Tips' the authors argue, 'the question of how to win at getting personal is crucial in the algorithmicization of romantic behavior. The crucial aspect here is to life actions out of the ensemble of behaviors of which they are a part, to detach movement, words, gestures, hormones, clothing, from a wider set of relation and to filter them in relation to a set of prepared and preferentially ordered triggers' (64). In this example, technology intersects with the thinking person in that various human factors are removed, and are instead, replaced by the technological functions 'inside the box' to continue the metaphor from earlier. 'Togetherness' thus explores the intersection of the human mind and technology, and the ambitions of unifying infrastructure and behavior—collective intelligence.</p><br>
<p>The 'default' settings of our devices today--our phones, web browsers, etc. are the manifestation of this intersection, in which both human factors influence the technological functions and vice versa. The concept of habituated settings is entirely human in origin--focusing on specific activities and preferences that the human mind repeatedly turns to. This human activity of course influenced the infrastructure of technology, implemented preprogrammed 'things' such as websites, apps, and settings. The default settings, however, influence human habits as well. For example, an iPhone starts up for the first time with the app 'Safari' as the default Internet browser. If a user wanted to use a different browser, they would have to actively search it, potentially pay for it, download it, and only then access it. The hope, of course, is that what technology has intentionally preprogrammed will somewhat unintentionally become what the human mind becomes preprogrammed to. In default settings there is both an algorithmicization of behavior and the naturalization of technology, resulting in information symmetry.</p><br>
<p> structures</p>
<p>The bureaucratic world described by Kafka, in its scenes of slow, abiding menace and confusion, is composed at the speed of paper. The rolling of an eyeball over text, the scratch and glide of an underling's fountain pen as documents are copied in triplicate, clacking typewriters measured in words per minute, the footfall of a courier moving documents from one office to another or that of a messenger delivering a summons, the time to arrive at a decision: the duration is that of waiting, of slow inscription by hand, of the invisibility of a decision-making process as it occurs through inscrutable ritual and the minds of the participants. Contemporary management systems that still involve the human in decision-making processes essentially operate at this speed. Paper-speed management, whether it has been made electronic or not, subsists on systems of forms in which requests and reports are made and reviewed in more or less standardized ways and approved or denied at a speed that at best resembles that of an organization's internal postal system or the time it takes to assemble the interorganizational thought on a decision.”</p><br>
<p>I look to the example of taking notes in class to provide insight to structure--students, in most cases, are granted the option of taking notes either by hand or on a computer. (Some classes may have strict rules one way or another) It has become increasingly popular to choose the typing option, and that is simply because most students can type faster than they write (among other things, like keeping distracted on social media, etc.). In my personal experience, when in a lecture, the wealth of information we are given comes at such a speed that I find myself focusing more so on typing everything important that is said rather than analyzing it at its face, spoken value – just so that I have it in my notes. When I engage in the physical 'learning' of the course, it is not in the class setting, but instead, at home, going through my notes.</p><br>



<p>technicalities</p>
<p>Technicalities, as presented by the authors, synthesizes data details, patterns, formalization, and the relations of such concepts to social relations--revealing the evils of media in doing so. Of workflows, the authors write of the 'contemporary imperative to design the social relations into which people are inserted--as a set of patterns' (106). They continue that workflows, 'highlight a significant point: the routinization of work within a formalized set of digital patterns depends on a whole weft of technologies, techniques, protocols, sets of know-how, and practices' (107). In the subtopic, 'Look After Your Relations' they talk of the 'normalization of data and the structures it is entered into' (115).</p><br>
<p>Google recently purchased Nest, a smart-thermostat of sorts. This purchase sparked comedic flack along the lines of Google 'emailing you fire extinguisher ads as it recognizes your house burning down.' What critics fail to recognize is Google's cleverness in trying to understand our behavior when we are offline. There are human patterns not previously understood by machines that are trying to be mechanized in hopes that social relations become patterized. In purchasing Nest, Google will be able to normalize the data of when humans aren’t online and use their technologies to routinize human behavior.</p><br>
<p>productivity</p>
<p>The other day, I was talking to my mom on the phone trying to help her set up her wireless printer to her computer.  I have set up my own computer to my own wireless printer, and I've set up her previous printer to her computer, so telling her the steps over the phone shouldn’t be a problem.  I started to attempt to explain that she had to install the printer software onto her computer, and from there she could then connect her printer to wifi, and then add the printer to her computer.  However, after explaining this to her, and after it resulting in her printer still not being setup, I realized that within these steps are many tiny steps.  These tiny steps are not only essentially automatic to me because I’ve grown up doing them, but they are also extremely hard to explain.  If I was on her computer setting it up, there would be no problem, because the explanation of the steps would not be an issue.  However, trying to explain the steps without doing it myself, I realized that my knowledge of such a simple task as setting up a wireless printer was not as complete as I thought.  I think this example speaks to the Productivity chapter in Evil Media, more specifically this concept of tacit knowledge.  In the chapter, it says that 'if your most prized possession-your knowledge-cannot be articulated explicitly or, more practically, turned into a formalism, who’s to say whether or not you really know what you claim to know?'  I told my mom that I know how to setup a wireless printer, but who’s to say I actually do if I am unable to setup her very printer which I claim to know all about?</p><br>
<p>excellence</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter of the book, 'Excellence,' the authors discuss 'the crucial importance of media operations… in the genesis of thinking and knowing' (168).  The authors start off the book with a call to action: to cultivate a knowledge that recognizes the manipulations of media and further, enlightens users on how to manipulate such technologies. The chapter 'Excellence' fulfills this purpose, discussing the different ways technologies can engineer human excellence. Excellence here, can be fulfilled by creating inherently transmissible codified strategies of virtuous exemplar or by using devices like scripts 'in the configuration of the generalized dramaturgy of the social' (158). Rather than let the evils of media emerge victorious over it’s users, the chapter turns this situation around where instead, the evils of media are manipulated to be advantageous for its users.  Over the last few years, IBM has been developing an artificially intelligent computer system called Watson that perfectly exemplifies this idea of technology engineering human excellence.  IBM developers have spent years plugging information into this system, even involving creatives to come up with a face for Watson, in order to compete on Jeopardy! against two of the best human players in history.  In 2011, when Watson competed against these two players, it won, and this accomplishment marked a huge step in the software system’s world.  Now IBM is figuring out ways to use Watson for real world problems using it’s impeccable decision making skills and accurate predictions.  This artificially intelligent system is a perfect example of how crucially important media operations have and will become in understanding the world around us, and making it a better place.</p><br>
<p>be artistic</p>
<p>This subtopic addresses the realm of creative coding, where 'creativity becomes not simply the domain of traditional intuition but what is traditionally considered its opposite, the meticulous attention to—and gaming of—rules' (157). Here, the divide between quantitative data and abstract images synthesizes. There are multiple examples of this in everyday technologies-most obviously, data visualizations. One example that stuck with me was the tracking of the spread of Ukraine’s political uprisings/protests/violence during the month of February through tweet mentions. The site, found <a href="http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/static_vizz/ukr.html">here</a> uses the technicalities of twitter, how many tweets mention the word Ukraine, and the different times these tweets were sent to create something visually stimulating and provocative. Similarly, the audio visualizer on iTunes applies the same principles of combining the rules with intuition—creating abstract visuals based off the specific sound compositions of songs.</p>
