<p>This is an exploration of affect, of nostalgia, and of the digital. The idea began in hopes of clarifying affect: the biological sensation that cannot be limited to mere emotional adjectives. While nostalgia is often associated with sentimentality, this term fails to incorporate the stomach-churning-but-euphoric intensity of nostalgia. And so it began. But the initial question remained: where to explore nostalgia</p> 
 <p>By 2008, The Polaroid Company and their factories were ready to shut down. Instead, two Polaroid employees together bought the last factory in the world manufacturing Polaroid instant film, saving analog instant photography from extinction. And thus The Impossible Project was born, a project to save, reinvent, and produce totally new instant film materials for traditional Polaroid cameras.</p> 
 <p> Part of this reinvention of Polaroid meant adapting to digital means. To do so, The Impossible Instant Lab was invented, which transforms any digital image into a real, unique analog instant photo via one’s iPhone or iPad.</p>
 <p> The Impossible Instant Lab produces a digital nostalgia. But what does it mean to experience nostalgia through a digital medium, to re-create nostalgia using iPhones? Such began the inquiry into my project. </p>
 <p> My exploration takes us to The Impossible Project Headquarters in New York City’s Soho. The headquarters functions as a store, a gallery, and a venue, a site in which they seek to transmit this affect of nostalgia to their customers. Can this affect be captured in a space? Further, can this affect be capitalized on and marketed, which is the ultimate goal of The Impossible Project? Most importantly, does the affect of nostalgia change when experienced through a digital medium? </p>
