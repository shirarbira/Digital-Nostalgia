<h1> Final Presentation Script </h1>
<p>Within our digital culture, nostalgia has become a unique media product. And as a media product, this type of nostalgia is invoked in order to sell. Brands, producers, and corporations like you all have come to realize that like sex, nostalgia sells. </p><br>
<p>In this sense, nostalgia is like a targeted ad—and the thing being advertised is a person’s own past. From the weekly “hashtag tbt”, to the “throwback track” playlist on Spotify, being immersed in our world of social media and technology places us in a unique position in relation to the nostalgia we experience. We have the capacity to scroll through Facebook photo albums and view the written comments from friends years back. We have the capacity to enter a song into the search bar of Spotify or Youtube and immediately be taken back to our middle school dances. We have the capacity to control when and how we experience our nostalgia. </p><br>
<p>And companies know this too—as Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinksi quote in their book, “Life After New Media”: “Playing a key role in the emergence of a wholly new mode of production, creativity became a marketable and transferrable commodity for the information age” (174). However,  as you may know, to capture, market, and transfer nostalgia presents itself as a difficult task. </p><br>
<p>Nostalgia is an affect, an intensity. But intensity doesn’t equal emotion: emotion is qualified intensity, it is intensity owned and recognized. Affect is an inexpressible energy, with the potential to alter the biochemistry and neurology of the subject. The transmission of affect is a process that is social in origin but biological and physical in effect. </p><br>
<p>To transmit affect is to transmit an atmosphere, the environmental literally must get into the individual. To transmit nostalgia is to transmit an atmosphere. This atmosphere must be layered: the sounds, the aesthetics, the composition of the room, must all work cohesively. </p><br>
<p>A new aspect has emerged in the experience of nostalgia, in experiencing nostalgia through a digital medium.</p><br>
<p>What is required is an audience. a shared space so that the nostalgia, the affect, the energy may transmit all around. yet this space is not physical, but instead digital. </p><br>
<p>It is through an app that digital nostalgia may be transmitted. </p><br>
<p>Brands, producers, and corporations like you all must take advantage of this technology, of this unique type of nostalgia pervading our culture today. it through a juxtaposition of the digital and the past that this unique nostalgia arises. </p><br>
<p>Turn digital on it’s head and sell your nostalgia as a new media product. </p>
