<h1> sound proposal </h1>
<p>My sound project is difficult to capture as my project focuses on affect and digital mediums—two essentially invisible concepts. The site I have been exploring is the headquarters for The Impossible Project, a company that began to remake and re-sell Polaroid film after it went out of business. In addition to just selling film, the company sells accessories such as technologies that turn Polaroid’s digital, or IPhone compatible Polaroid’s. Essentially, the company is trying to capitalize off the affect of nostalgia while still selling itself as something digital and modern, something tailored to millennials.
<p><br>
  
  In order to achieve this fundamentally financially driven goal, the headquarters must too promote this affect of nostalgia they so wish to sell. I’ve attempted to capture the background noise of the building, the soundtrack playing softly, yet loud enough that it can have an emotional or as Massumi would call it, intensive experience for those who enter the store. This background music is incredibly important; it sets the mood, invites a certain demographic and promotes a certain lifestyle. The background noise, while seemingly just background, is incredibly functional and significant.
<p><br>
  
  The other sounds I have attempted to capture are the noises of the actual Polaroid cameras, and of the photo booth machine within the store. These sounds are interesting as they are machine-noises, noises of dead-labor, yet the capture a sound that is comforting to hear, evoking nostalgia. The sound of the Polaroid flash reverberating its meaningful, it’s more than just the inner workings of a machine.
<p><br>
  I think it would be interesting to compare the Polaroid noses to the noises of an IPhone camera, or other Internet noises. While all the sounds are fundamentally the same—non-human, non-natural, inorganic, machine noises, the Polaroid noise has affective potential.<br>
  
  In the same way I hope my website has affective composition, I hope the sounds function in the same way, evoking the affect of nostalgia through a digital medium.</p>
